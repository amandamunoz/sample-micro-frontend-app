This is an application that illustrates the use of micro-frontends. It contains code using both react and vue, using [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa) to tie it all together. 

------

To run the app:
```bash
npm start
```
------
The `react-only` branch is only a react app.

The `react-and-single-spa` branch shows react working with the [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa) library.

The `main` branch shows a react and vue app working side-by-side, using [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa).

------
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
